# Search Algorithms

In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values. Specific applications of search algorithms include:

Problems in combinatorial optimization, such as:
The vehicle routing problem, a form of shortest path problem
The knapsack problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
The nurse scheduling problem
Problems in constraint satisfaction, such as:
The map coloring problem
Filling in a sudoku or crossword puzzle
